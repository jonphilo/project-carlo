We speak in movie quotes, will debate just about anything, and look very much alike (though we'll both deny it). To be fair, we grew up doing just about everything together. Whether it was playing video games or backyard football with my dad, my brother was always around.  While I know he loves to push my buttons, he's someone I know I can count on. </p>

They have always been there for me and I know that these are friends that I will have for the rest of my life no matter where life takes us.</p>

Meeting an older brother can often be very intimidating (especially if you happen to be dating his younger sister). Turns out I had nothing to fear as Jonathan is one of the most laid back people I've met. We've since bonded over our love of video games, computers specs, and Xavier basketball. I'm happy to call Jon a friend and am glad he gets to be a part of our wedding.</p>
